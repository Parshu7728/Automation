Disclaimer
In this report, you will find information related to the barrier performance of certain personal protective equipment (PPE) against the chemicals 
you selected. This information is intended to enable the Health and Safety professional at your organization make more informed decisions 
about the Ansell PPE that may offer the greatest protection in the intended circumstances and assist with carrying out a risk assessment for your 
organization.
We wish to highlight that permeation times do not equate to safe wear time. Safe wear time may vary depending on whether the PPE is donned 
correctly, the surrounding temperature, the chemicals’ toxicity, and other factors. Permeation information offered here is limited to the main 
protective material. Permeation times may vary around seams, zips, visors or any other joins or components of the PPE. It is the responsibility of 
your organization’s Health and Safety professional to undertake a risk assessment before choosing the appropriate PPE for the task at hand. If 
you want to discuss any aspect in detail, please contact us.
Estimations of the barrier properties of PPE are based on currently available data and extrapolations from laboratory test results and information regarding the chemicals’ composition. 
Synergistic effects of mixing chemicals have not been accounted for. Estimations are subject to change if new testing is carried out or new information is available providing better grounds 
for extrapolations. For these reasons, any information in this report is provided for informational purposes only and Ansell fully disclaims any liability including warranties related to any 
statement contained herein.

Cumulative Permeation
Cumulative permeation (as opposed to breakthrough times) deals with the amount of chemical permeating through the 
material, and not the speed (rate) as with the breakthrough times. The two results concerned with this for ISO 16602 are: 
CPt, the time in minutes it takes for the cumulative permeation to reach 150 μg /cm , and CP, the cumulative permeation 2
(in μg /cm ) by the end of the test (usually 480 minutes).2
Permeation Breakthrough Times - BT0.1
The BT  is the time taken (in minutes) for the chemical in question to be permeating through the material at a rate of 0.1 0.1
μg /cm /min. This can be determined with a number of standard test methods including ASTM F739. It is commonly used 2
mainly within the regions concerned with ASTM standards.
Permeation Breakthrough Times - BT1.0
The BT  is the time taken (in minutes) for the chemical in question to be permeating through the material at a rate of 1.0 1.0
μg /cm /min. This can be determined with a number of standard test methods including EN 16523-1 and ISO 6529. It is 2
commonly used mainly within the regions concerned with EN and ISO standards.
